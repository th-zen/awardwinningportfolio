      So there once was this wasp that lived in a jungle. This was not your ordinary wasp though-he was smart,
      philosophical even. One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he 
      would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world 
      and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with 
      flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 
      3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to 
      Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again 
      a 4.0, on the Dean’s list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the 
      newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on 
      campus. Even his professors looked up to him.
      
      He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. 
      How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. 
      After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and 
      wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor 
      and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp 
      decides he might as well go for it.
      
      Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly 
      well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for 
      cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) 
      the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s departure, 
      but they all know it’s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving 
      office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn’t been back to his hive at 
      all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his 
      parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. 
      He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has 
      gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old 
      watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an extremely long line. He decides it’s 
      worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s ever seen! 
      Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s 
      not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of 
      people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! 
      So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there’s no punch line. </p></div>
